\alias{getNonEdgeSamples}
\title{Converts an edge sample string into an array of indexes of samples belonging to the Noncluseter.
This was made so that I can control which edges are included (0,7,8,9)}
\usage{
getNonEdgeSamples(i, net)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{The index of the edge in the network}

\item{net}{A network dataframe containing the KINC-produced network.  The loadNetwork
function imports a dataframe in the correct format for this function.}
}
\value{
An array of sample indexes that are part of the Noncluster. Because these
  indexes are derived from the edge sample string they indexes should
  correspond to the order of samples in the expression matrix.
}
